learning XML

    What is xml
    
    Xml (eXtensible Markup Language) is a mark up language.
    XML is designed to store and transport data.
    Xml was released in late 90â€™s. it was created to provide an easy to use and store self describing data.
    XML became a W3C Recommendation on February 10, 1998.
    XML is not a replacement for HTML.
    XML is designed to be self-descriptive.
    XML is designed to carry data, not to display data.
    XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags.
    XML is platform independent and language independent.
    
    ?Many corporation use XML due to its platform independent feature
    
    Features and Advantages of XML
    
    ?it edits the html page dynamically if you have a lot of data changing
    ?xml stores data in plain text format making things very compatible
    ?when platform upgrade is needed, XML is the way to go
    ?XML makes data more available
    ?XML can make new web-tech languages such as
        XHTML
        WSDL
        RSS
        
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <note>
      <to>Tove</to>
      <from>Jani</from>
      <heading>Reminder</heading>
      <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>
    
    The first line is the XML declaration. It defines the XML version (1.0) and the encoding used (ISO-8859-1 = Latin-1/West European character set).
    
    The next line describes the root element of the document (like saying: "this document is a note"):
    
    everything inside are the child elements
    
    file :first_xml.xml
    
    XML Related Technologies
    
No.	Technology	Meaning	Description
1)	XHTML	Extensible html	It is a clearer and stricter version of XML. It belongs to the family of XML markup languages. It was developed to make html more extensible and increase inter-operability with other data.
2)	XML DOM	XML document object model	It is a standard document model that is used to access and manipulate XML. It defines the XML file in tree structure.
3)	XSL
it contain three parts:
i) XSLT (xsl transform)
ii) XSL
iii)XPath	Extensible style sheet language
i) It transforms XML into other formats, like html.
ii) It is used for formatting XML to screen, paper etc.
iii) It is a language to navigate XML documents.
4)	XQuery	XML query language	It is a XML based language which is used to query XML based data.
5)	DTD	Document type definition	It is an standard which is used to define the legal elements in an XML document.
6)	XSD	XML schema definition	It is an XML based alternative to dtd. It is used to describe the structure of an XML document.
7)	XLink	XML linking language	xlink stands for XML linking language. This is a language for creating hyperlinks (external and internal links) in XML documents.
8)	XPointer	XML pointer language	It is a system for addressing components of XML based internet media. It allows the xlink hyperlinks to point to more specific parts in the XML document.
9)	SOAP	Simple object access protocol	It is an acronym stands simple object access protocol. It is XML based protocol to let applications exchange information over http. in simple words you can say that it is protocol used for accessing web services.
10)	WSDL	web services description languages	It is an XML based language to describe web services. It also describes the functionality offered by a web service.

13)	RSS	Really simple syndication	RSS is a XML-based format to handle web content syndication. It is used for fast browsing for news and updates. It is generally used for news like sites.

    
    XML Attributes
    
        ?adds information about edited element
        ?Note: XML attributes must always be quoted. We can use single or double quote.
        
        syntax
        
        <element [attribute] = "[value]"></element>
        the value is known as metadata
        
        you should avoid them however instead use the subelement version which looks like this
        
        <element>
        <attribute [aka subelement]> [data]</attribute>
        </element>
        
    XML Comments
        
        ? cannot nest XML comments one inside another
        syntax
        ?Don't use a comment before an XML declaration.
        ?You can use a comment anywhere in XML document except within attribute value
        
        syntax
        
            <!-- Write your comment-->
            
    XML Tree Structure
    
        how XML works, the way whatever compiler or intrepreter traverses an XML document
        
        Descendants and ancestors just like a tree
        
    XML Validation
    
        ?well formed XML document is XML with valid syntax
        
        Valid XML document
        
            It must be well formed (satisfy all the basic syntax condition)
            It should be behave according to predefined DTD or XML schema
            
            rules
            
                ?It must begin with the XML declaration.-->
                ?It must have one unique root element.
                ?All start tags of XML documents must match end tags.
                ?XML tags are case sensitive.
                ?All elements must be closed.
                ?All elements must be properly nested.
                ?All attributes values must be quoted.
                ?XML entities must be used for special characters.

    XML DTD
    
        stands for Document Type Definition
        ?legal building blocks for any xml document

        Visit http://www.xmlvalidation.com to validate the XML file
        
        when validation with DTD the xml file needs this to come after the xml declaration
        
            <!DOCTYPE [xml file name without.xml] SYSTEM "[xml file name without.xml].dtd">
        
        in the .dtd file you need
        
            <!ELEMENT [tagname] ([child element],[child element] ...)>
            or
            <!ELEMENT [tagname] (#PCDATA)>
            
        for every element in the xml file
        
        file: DTD validation folder employee.xml, employee.dtd
        
        XML DTD with entity declaration
        
        different way of doing things
        an entity has three parts
            An ampersand (&)
            An entity name
            A semicolon (;)
        to make it
        
            <?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes" ?>
                <!DOCTYPE [filename] [
                  <!ELEMENT [filename] (#PCDATA)>
                  <!--this is the root element it needs the same name is the filename-->
                  <!ENTITY [variable] "[data]">
                ]>
                <author>&data;</author>
                
        file xml_dtd_entity.xml
        
    XML CSS
    
        CSS in XML is used to format the whole XML document
        
        to link
        
            <?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="cssemployee.css"?>
            
        in the css file refer to tutor.txt, for editing the xml there is the same as editing the html
        
        however you should use XSLT to edit XML files
        
        folder: xml_css
        
    XML schema
    
        language expressing constraint about xml
            <there are "several of them out there">
                <more control "about xml docuiment">
                    
        <xs:element name="employee"> : It defines the element name employee.
        
        <xs:complexType> : It defines that the element 'employee' is complex type.
        
        <xs:sequence> : It defines that the complex type is a sequence of elements.
        
            simpleType
            complexType
            simpleType
            
            The simpleType allows you to have text-based elements. It contains less attributes, child elements, and cannot be left empty.
            
            complexType
            
            The complexType allows you to hold multiple attributes and elements. It can contain additional sub elements and can be left empty.
            
            folder: XML_SCHEMA
            
    XML CDATA
    
        (Unparsed Character data):
        syntax
        <![CDATA[
          prints it out like a string
        ]]>
        
        so in the browser it prints like a strings
        
        file:xml_cdata.xml
    
    XML PCDATA
    
        (Parsed Character Data)
        
        regular data between the xml tags
        
        file:xml_pcdata.xml
        
    XML Parsers
    
        read XML data and make it easier for programs to use XML
        
            <types></types>
            
            DOM and SAX
            
    XML DOM
    
        opens .xml into http browser for the data to be used by javascript
        
        to get from external .xml
        
        <script
        if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
          {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
          xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
          }
        else
          {// code for IE6, IE5
          xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
          }
        xmlhttp.open("GET","[file].xml",false);
        xmlhttp.send();
        xmlDoc=xmlhttp.responseXML;
        <!--xmlDoc, treat it as an html page now, but know it there to edit your html page based off the javascript or jquery events->
        ></script>
        
        ? doesn't work on chrome because of cross browser origin

        to get from javascript
        
        <script>
            txt = "string";
            if (window.DOMParser)
              {
              parser=new DOMParser();
              xmlDoc=parser.parseFromString(txt,"text/xml");
              }
            else // Internet Explorer
              {
              xmlDoc=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM");
              xmlDoc.async=false;
              xmlDoc.loadXML(txt);
              }
        </script>
        
        folder: XML_DOM
    XML Database
    
        < XML database is a data persistence software system used for storing the huge amount of information in XML format. It provides a secure place to store XML documents." >
        
        <types></types>
         
            xml-enabled
            
                XML-enable database works just like a relational database. It is like an extension provided for the conversion of XML documents. In this database, data is stored in table, in the form of rows and columns
            
            Native XML Database
            
                stored as a container, which you can easily query
                
                file native_xml_database.xml
                
    XML Namespace
    
        used so there is no confusion in xml document
        so if you are talking about the same object, you can use different namespaces to differentiate the data
        
        syntax
        
            <[name]: [root_element] xmlns:[name] = "URL">
                <[name]:[child_element]></[name]:[child_element]>
                
                name specifies an association and url specifies where the association only applies to
                
                to make it work you can use the prefix before the element or using the root tag and placing the xmlns in the filename tag or all the xmlns in the root tag itself
                
        <default namespace></default>
        
            <tutorials xmlns="http://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial">'
            
            when you do this you do not need prefixes
